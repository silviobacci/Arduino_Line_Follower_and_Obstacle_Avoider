# Arduino_Line_Follower_and_Obstacle_Avoider
The project is realized thanks to a Parallax Robot Shield equipped with an Arduino M0 pro, 6 infrared QTR-8A Pololu sensors and a digital ultrasound HC-SR04 Itead Studio sensor. The project aims to realize a robot able to follow a black line of a white floot avoiding predefined obstacles arranged on the path.

## About 
This work has been realized in University of Pisa/Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in the context of Design of Embedded Systems exam.
